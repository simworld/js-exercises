    <h1>Exercises</h1>

    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>

    <p>Write a function to take a list of names (first name &lt;space&gt; last name), proper case the
        name (capitalise the first letter, lowercase the rest – each word), and output the list as a
        HTML Table element (one row per name, one column for each of first name, last name). Try
        to format the html string correctly using “\n” and “\t” characters</p>

    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <p class="numberOne"></p>

    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>    

    <p>Write a function to take a list of fruit (eg apple, orange, pear etc), and transform that list into
        a new list of filenames, assuming the files have a “jpeg” extension, and a source folder of
        “../img/”. Output the new list of files as a series HTML img tags, where the filename is the
        src attribute. Try to format the html string correctly using “\n” and “\t” characters
    </p>

    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <!-- <img class="numberTwo"></img> -->
    <section class="numberTwo"></section>

    <h2>Exercise 3</h2>   
    
    <p>Write a function to take a list of the planets in the solar system, and to output a stream of
        HTML, such that you have a div element for each planet, display the planets name, and
        transforms the planets name into a url, which acts as the source for an img tag. Assume the
        images are in the “./img/” folder with a “jpeg” extension. Try to format the html string
        correctly using “\n” and “\t” characters
    </p>

    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <p class="numberThree"></p>

    <h2>Exercise 4</h2>    

    <p>Write a function to take the list of planets, and create a HTML table structure, with the name
        of the planet in one column, and the image of the planet in the second column. Assume the
        images are in the “./img/” folder with a “jpeg” extension. Try to format the html string
        correctly using “\n” and “\t” characters
    </p>

    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <p class="numberFour"></p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 5</h2>    

    <p>Write a function to take a list of the class members (first names only), and return a new list,
        with each name being used as an email address on the domain eg tom@finglas.cdetb.ie.
        Then output the list as a series of anchors (HTML A Tag) with the email address as the url,
        using the mailto protocol. Here is a document that explains “mailto” as part of the url
        https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html
    </p>

    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <p class="numberFive"></p>
